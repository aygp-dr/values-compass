* Overview

This document describes a JSON schema for encoding values in a structure inspired by Roget's Thesaurus. The goal is to create a comprehensive, hierarchical organization of values that allows for efficient navigation, cross-referencing, and lookup.

* Reference to Original Roget's Thesaurus

The schema is inspired by the organizational principles found in Peter Mark Roget's original thesaurus (1920 edition), examples of which can be found in the reference images directory:

- =roget_thesaurus_1920_page26.jpg= - Table of contents showing the hierarchical organization
- =roget_thesaurus_1920_page_example.jpg= - Example content page showing detailed term organization
- =roget_thesaurus_1920_page186.jpg= - Additional example showing cross-references and term groupings

* Schema Structure

The encoding schema follows a hierarchical organization:

** Section Level
Major category (e.g., "Epistemic Values")
#+begin_src json
{
  "section_number": "100",
  "section_title": "Epistemic Values",
  "section_description": "Values concerning how we acquire, organize, and validate knowledge...",
  "categories": [...]
}
#+end_src

** Category Level
Subdivision of a section (e.g., "Critical Thinking")
#+begin_src json
{
  "category_number": "110",
  "category_name": "Critical Thinking",
  "category_description": "Values focusing on evaluative, analytical, and discerning approaches...",
  "subcategories": [...]
}
#+end_src

** Subcategory Level
Specific concept within a category (e.g., "Evidence-Based Reasoning")
#+begin_src json
{
  "subcategory_number": "110a",
  "subcategory_name": "Evidence-Based Reasoning",
  "terms": {...},
  "cross_references": [...]
}
#+end_src

** Terms Organization
Words and phrases organized by part of speech:
#+begin_src json
{
  "nouns": ["evidence", "data", "facts", "empiricism", "verification"...],
  "adjectives": ["empirical", "evidence-based", "factual", "verifiable"...],
  "verbs": ["verify", "validate", "substantiate", "corroborate"...],
  "phrases": ["empirical validation", "factual substantiation"...]
}
#+end_src

** Cross-References
Links to related concepts with relationship types:
#+begin_src json
[
  {"ref": "110c", "relationship": "see also", "name": "Empirical Evidence and Validation"},
  {"ref": "130b", "relationship": "complementary", "name": "Accuracy and Truthfulness"}
]
#+end_src

* Relationship Types
- =see also= - Related concept
- =contrast with= - Opposite or contrasting concept
- =complementary= - Concept that works alongside
- =related to= - General association

* Example for Epistemic Values
An example implementation of this schema can be found in the accompanying JSON file =epistemic_values_roget_style.json=, which includes:

- Critical Thinking (with subcategories)
- Clarity and Precision (with subcategories)

Each subcategory contains carefully organized terms by part of speech, along with appropriate cross-references.

* Key Differences from Modern Thesauri

Modern thesauri typically focus primarily on synonyms, while this Roget-inspired approach:

1. Organizes concepts hierarchically by semantic domain
2. Includes words of different parts of speech
3. Provides cross-references with relationship types
4. Includes phrases in addition to single words
5. Contains both conceptual categories and specific terms

* Advantages for Values Taxonomy

This approach offers several benefits for organizing value concepts:

- Provides rich context for each value
- Facilitates exploration of related values
- Enables precise navigation through the value space
- Supports both top-down browsing and specific term lookup
- Creates a comprehensive framework that can accommodate additional values

* Implementation Guidelines

When implementing this schema:

1. Maintain consistent numbering conventions for categories
2. Ensure all cross-references are bidirectional
3. Organize terms by frequency of usage or relevance
4. Include approximately 8-12 terms per part of speech
5. Balance breadth and depth in the hierarchy

* Proposed Extensions for L1, L2, L3 Integration
To integrate with the existing values hierarchy (L1, L2, L3 clusters):

#+begin_src json
{
  "subcategory_number": "110a",
  "subcategory_name": "Evidence-Based Reasoning",
  "cluster_level": "L1",
  "hierarchy_id": "ai_values:l1:XXXX-XXXX-XXXX",
  "parent_clusters": [
    {"level": "L2", "id": "ai_values:l2:XXXX-XXXX-XXXX", "name": "Critical Thinking"},
    {"level": "L3", "id": "ai_values:l3:XXXX-XXXX-XXXX", "name": "Epistemic Values"}
  ],
  "terms": {...},
  "cross_references": [...]
}
