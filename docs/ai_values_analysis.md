2. **Professional Standards**: The highest-ranked specific value is "Professional standards and conduct" (6.29%), highlighting the importance of defining proper behavior for AI systems and developers.

3. **Epistemic & Social Balance**: Epistemic values (22.20%) and social values (21.41%) are nearly equally represented, suggesting a balance between knowledge/accuracy concerns and social/relational considerations in AI ethics.

4. **Protective Values Position**: While protective values (including ethical responsibility and protecting rights) are present, they represent only 13.86% of occurrences, less than practical, epistemic, or social values.

5. **Community Bonds**: The second highest Level 2 category is "Community and relationship bonds" (15.19%), highlighting the importance of how AI systems interact with human social networks.

This analysis provides a quantitative view of which values are most frequently associated with AI systems and ethics discussions, helping to understand prioritization and emphasis in the field.
