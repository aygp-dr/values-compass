* Presentation Materials

This directory contains presentation materials for the Values Compass project.

** Main Presentation

The main presentation can be built from the root directory using:

#+begin_src bash
make presentation.pdf
#+end_src

The presentation covers:
- Values Compass project overview
- Cross-framework mapping approach
- Technical implementation
- Results and insights
- Applications and future work

** QR Code Generation

QR codes for repository access are generated automatically as part of the presentation build. These can also be generated separately:

#+begin_src bash
# Generate SVG version
make github_repo_qr.svg

# Generate PNG version
make github_repo_qr.png
#+end_src

** Environment Setup

Before building the presentation, ensure you have the required dependencies:

#+begin_src bash
make setup-presentation
#+end_src

This will install:
- LaTeX packages needed for beamer presentations
- PDF presentation tools (pdfpc)
- QR code generation tools

** Presenting

To present the PDF with presenter notes, use:

#+begin_src bash
pdfpc presentation.pdf
#+end_src

This provides a dual-screen view with timer, notes, and navigation controls.

* Development Notes

** Adding Images

** Custom Slide Themes

The current presentation uses:
- Beamer theme: Frankfurt
- Color theme: seahorse
- Font theme: structurebold

To modify these settings, edit the header of =presentation.org=.
