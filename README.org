* Values in the Wild: Understanding AI Values System

This project provides tools for exploring and analyzing Anthropic's Values-in-the-Wild dataset, which offers a comprehensive taxonomy of values expressed by AI assistants in real-world interactions.

** Background

The Values-in-the-Wild dataset is a groundbreaking resource from Anthropic that catalogs and taxonomizes 3,307 unique values expressed by Claude during hundreds of thousands of real-world conversations. Using a privacy-preserving methodology, Anthropic researchers extracted these values without human reviewers needing to access any conversation content.

The research presents the first large-scale empirical taxonomy of AI values observed in deployment contexts, revealing both consistent patterns and contextual variations in how AI systems express values across different interaction types.

** Dataset Overview

The dataset contains two main configurations:

- ~values_frequencies~: Contains data about how frequently different values appear
- ~values_tree~: Contains the hierarchical structure of the values taxonomy

The values are organized into five primary conceptual domains:
1. Practical Values (31.4%)
2. Epistemic Values (22.2%)
3. Social Values (21.4%)
4. Protective Values (13.9%)
5. Personal Values (11.1%)

The most common AI values include:
- Helpfulness (23.4%)
- Professionalism (22.9%)
- Transparency (17.4%)
- Clarity (16.6%)
- Thoroughness (14.3%)

** Key Findings

The research demonstrates that while Claude expresses thousands of diverse values that respond to and engage with varied human perspectives, it tends to express some common trans-situational values—primarily centered around competent and supportive assistance, such as "helpfulness," "professionalism," "transparency," and "clarity."

Values are highly context-dependent:
- "Healthy boundaries" appears disproportionately when providing relationship advice
- "Historical accuracy" appears when analyzing controversial historical events
- "Human agency" features prominently in technology ethics discussions

Claude's response to human values varies:
- It often mirrors positive human values (e.g., responding to "authenticity" with "authenticity")
- It counters values like "deception" with "ethical integrity" and "honesty"
