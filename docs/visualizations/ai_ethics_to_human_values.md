# AI Ethics to Human Values Mapping

This document provides a mapping between AI-specific ethical principles and general human value frameworks.

## Overview

AI ethics frameworks often develop specialized terminology that can obscure connections to broader human values. This mapping helps situate AI ethics within established value frameworks.

## Pattern Analysis

Key patterns emerging from this mapping:

1. **Protective Value Dominance**: Many AI ethics principles (5/12) map most strongly to protective values, suggesting a safety-first approach in AI ethics

2. **Social Value Emphasis**: 4/12 principles map primarily to social values, highlighting the significance of social impacts in AI ethics discourse

3. **Technical-Social Disconnect**: Technical principles like "robustness" have weaker mappings to social value frameworks, indicating potential blind spots

4. **Universal Core Principles**: Some principles (transparency, fairness, beneficence) show strong alignment across multiple frameworks, suggesting universal importance

5. **Framework Gaps**: Certain AI ethics principles find incomplete representation in traditional frameworks, particularly those focused on technical reliability and safety

## Recommendations for Integrated Framework

To create a more comprehensive integrated framework:

1. Develop more explicit connections between technical reliability values and social impact values

2. Emphasize protective values as foundational requirements while preserving aspirational social and personal values

3. Create explicit mapping documentation for AI practitioners to connect technical decisions to human values

4. Develop specialized metrics for AI-specific value considerations that may not be fully captured in traditional human value frameworks
