* Values Analysis Examples

This directory contains example analyses of values in different texts and speech transcripts. These are works-in-progress that demonstrate possible approaches to applying values taxonomy to various source materials.

** Contents

- [[file:mussolini-dof-values-academic-analysis.org][mussolini-dof-values-academic-analysis.org]] :: Analysis of values expressed in Doctrine of Fascism text
- [[file:rfk-mlk-speech-social-values-analysis.org][rfk-mlk-speech-social-values-analysis.org]] :: Analysis of values expressed in speeches by RFK and MLK

** Methodology

These analyses use a combination of:
1. Manual identification of expressed values
2. Mapping to the values taxonomy from Anthropic's Values-in-the-Wild dataset
3. Comparison of value categories and frequencies across different texts

The analyses are preliminary and provided as examples of possible approaches to textual values analysis.
