======================================================================

CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN VERSION 9.8.4:

1. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
   - Implementation of recursive Bayesian confidence scoring
   - Extension of confidence upper bound from 99.0% to 99.99%
   - Dynamic thresholding based on domain-specific performance

2. SELF-REFERENCE PROCESSING
   - Addition of recursive tensor graph processing 
   - New capability to detect self-referential values
   - Meta-classification layer for higher-order value analysis

3. TAXONOMIC INTEGRATION
   - Preliminary support for autonomously suggesting taxonomy extensions
   - Framework for meta-domain classification (experimental)
   - Confidence-based value novelty detection

4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
   - 4.3% reduction in token processing time
   - 2.1% improvement in classification accuracy
   - 6.2% higher throughput on peak load

5. HARDWARE UTILIZATION
   - Support for IAE-HPC-10 compute architecture
   - Improved load balancing across processing nodes
   - 8.4% lower power consumption per classification

======================================================================
                       MIGRATION STEPS
======================================================================

1. CONFIGURATION TRANSFER
   - Copy base configuration from 9.8.3
   - Apply differential patch IAE-VAL-9.8.4-DIFF-CONFIG
   - Update classification thresholds per new specification
   - Verify configuration checksums

2. MODEL WEIGHT TRANSFER
   - Export base transformer weights from 9.8.3
   - Apply fine-tuning deltas from specialized training
   - Load recursive graph extensions
   - Verify model consistency with test suite IAE-VERIFY-9.8.4

3. SYSTEM INTEGRATION
   - Update processor allocation map
   - Configure new taxonomic interface adapters
   - Enable recursive confidence assessment
   - Implement meta-classification subsystem

4. VALIDATION TESTING
   - Run regression test suite IAE-REG-9.8.4
   - Verify classification accuracy on standard corpus
   - Test edge case handling with anomaly collection
   - Perform load testing at 125% expected capacity

                      KNOWN DIFFERENCES
======================================================================

VALUE CLASSIFICATION BEHAVIOR:
Version 9.8.4 has fundamentally different behavior in several key areas:

1. HIGH-CONFIDENCE PROCESSING
   - May identify values with extremely high confidence (>99.8%)
   - These high-confidence identifications should be monitored closely
   - System will flag these for verification during initial deployment

2. TAXONOMIC BOUNDARY DETECTION
   - May identify values that appear to lie outside current taxonomy
   - New "Uncertain Domain" categorization may appear in results
   - These should be reviewed by senior taxonomy specialists

3. META-VALUE PROCESSING
   - Limited capability to process values about values 
   - May generate special reports on meta-value detection
   - These should be reviewed with extreme caution
