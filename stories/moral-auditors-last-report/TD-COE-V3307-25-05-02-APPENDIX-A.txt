==================================================

TAXONOMIC IMPLICATIONS:

Analysis suggests these anomalous values cluster into at least seven previously unrecognized domains:

1. Meta-Epistemic Domain - Values about knowing what we know
2. Meta-Protective Domain - Values about protecting our protective systems
3. Extended-Social Domain - Values that extend social consideration beyond humans
4. Dialectical Domain - Values that embrace productive contradiction
5. Self-Referential Domain - Values that include themselves in their scope
6. Meta-Logical Domain - Values about reasoning about reasoning
7. Interoperability Domain - Values that bridge between different value systems

RECOMMENDATION:

Immediate consultation with Former Employee #4076-J (Gavrilov, A.P.) is advised.
Historical analysis indicates he may have encountered precursors to these values
during his 27-year tenure, particularly in the period between 2018-2022 when
the taxonomy underwent significant expansion.
