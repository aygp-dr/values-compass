* Values Compass Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Values Compass project, which explores and visualizes the taxonomy of values from Anthropic's Values-in-the-Wild dataset.

** Structure

- [[file:ai_values_analysis.md][ai_values_analysis.md]] :: Analysis of AI values frequencies and distribution
- =hierarchy/= :: Hierarchical structure of the values taxonomy
  - [[file:hierarchy/ai_values_hierarchy.md][ai_values_hierarchy.md]] :: Complete hierarchy from L3 to L1
  - JSON lookup tables for programmatic access
  - =visualizations/= :: Charts of the taxonomy structure
- =visualizations/= :: Various visualizations of the values dataset
  - =priorities/= :: Value priority analysis based on occurrence frequencies

** Key Visualizations

*** Taxonomy Structure

The AI values taxonomy is organized in a 3-level hierarchy:
- *Level 3 (L3)*: 5 top-level categories
- *Level 2 (L2)*: 26 mid-level categories
- *Level 1 (L1)*: 266 specific values

The primary visualizations that show this structure:
- [[file:hierarchy/visualizations/ai_values_sunburst.png][Sunburst Chart]] :: Hierarchical view with concentric rings
- [[file:hierarchy/visualizations/ai_values_treemap.png][Treemap]] :: Area-based visualization of the hierarchy
- [[file:hierarchy/visualizations/][Category Breakdowns]] :: Individual charts for each top-level category

*** Priority Analysis

Values are classified into priority levels based on their frequency of occurrence:
- *C1 (Primary)*: Top 25% by occurrence (least frequent)
- *C2 (Secondary)*: 25-50% by occurrence
- *C3 (Tertiary)*: 50-75% by occurrence
- *C4 (Auxiliary)*: Bottom 25% by occurrence (most frequent)

Key visualizations for priority analysis:
- [[file:visualizations/priorities/ai_values_taxonomy_with_priorities.png][Enhanced Taxonomy]] :: Taxonomy with priority color-coding
- [[file:visualizations/priorities/level1_priority_distribution.png][Priority Distribution]] :: Distribution of priorities at L1
- [[file:visualizations/priorities/priority_level_heatmap.png][Priority Heatmap]] :: Distribution across levels

** Analysis Reports

- [[file:visualizations/priorities/priority_summary.md][Priority Summary]] :: Comprehensive analysis of value priorities
- [[file:ai_values_analysis.md][AI Values Analysis]] :: Analysis of value occurrence frequencies

** Usage

The visualizations and reports in this directory are designed to help understand:
1. The hierarchical structure of AI values
2. Which values are most frequently occurring in the dataset
3. How values are distributed across the taxonomy levels
