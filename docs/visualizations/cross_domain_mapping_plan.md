# Cross-Domain Value Mapping Extension Plan

## Additional Cross-Domain Mapping Work

This document outlines planned work to extend our cross-framework value mapping implementation.

### 1. Mapping to Schwartz Value Survey

The Schwartz Value Survey represents one of the most empirically validated frameworks for understanding human values across cultures. We'll implement a comprehensive mapping between Values in the Wild and the 10 basic values identified by Schwartz:

| Schwartz Value | Definition | VITW Primary Mapping | Secondary Mappings |
|----------------|------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Self-Direction | Independent thought and action | Epistemic (autonomy) | Personal (authenticity) |
| Stimulation | Excitement, novelty, challenge | Personal (growth) | Epistemic (curiosity) |
| Hedonism | Pleasure and sensuous gratification | Personal (wellbeing) | - |
| Achievement | Personal success via competence | Practical (excellence) | Personal (growth) |
| Power | Social status and prestige | Social (influence) | Practical (impact) |
| Security | Safety, harmony, stability | Protective (stability) | Social (community) |
| Conformity | Restraint of actions/impulses | Social (cohesion) | Protective (regulation) |
| Tradition | Respect for customs/traditions | Social (cultural) | Protective (continuity) |
| Benevolence | Preserving welfare of in-group | Social (care) | Protective (safety) |
| Universalism | Understanding, appreciation | Epistemic (understanding) | Social (fairness) |

### 2. Interactive Visualization Development

We'll extend our current visualization tools to support interactive exploration:

- **D3.js Implementation**: Create browser-based interactive visualizations
- **Framework Toggle**: Allow users to show/hide specific frameworks
- **Confidence Filters**: Filter connections by confidence level
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific values across frameworks
- **Drill-Down Capabilities**: Explore hierarchical relationships

### 3. Quantitative Similarity Metrics

Develop mathematical models to calculate similarity between value frameworks:

```python
def calculate_framework_similarity(framework1, framework2, method="cosine"):
    """
    Calculate similarity between two value frameworks.
    
    Args:
        framework1: First ValueFramework object
        framework2: Second ValueFramework object
        method: Similarity method ("cosine", "jaccard", or "euclidean")
        
    Returns:
        Similarity score between 0-1
    """
    # Implementation details will depend on embedding method
    pass
```

Proposed metrics:
- Embedding-based similarity (using semantic vectors)
- Structural similarity (based on hierarchical alignment)
- Cross-mapping coverage percentage
- Network graph metrics (centrality, clustering)

### 4. AI-Specific Value Mapping

Create specialized mappings between AI ethical frameworks and general human values:

| AI-Specific Value | Definition | General Human Value | Framework |
|------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Explainability | AI systems should be understandable | Transparency | Epistemic Values |
| Fairness | AI should treat all people fairly | Justice | Social Values |
| Privacy | AI should respect data privacy | Security | Protective Values |
| Beneficence | AI should benefit humanity | Benevolence | Social Values |
| Non-maleficence | AI should not cause harm | Care, Safety | Protective Values |
| Autonomy | Human choice should be preserved | Self-Direction | Personal Values |
| Responsibility | Clear accountability for AI systems | Duty | Protective Values |

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description | Timeline |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Schwartz Values mapping | Week 1-2 |
| 2 | Quantitative similarity metrics | Week 2-3 |
| 3 | AI-specific value mapping | Week 3-4 |
| 4 | Interactive visualization tools | Week 4-6 |

## Tooling & Resources

- Embedding models: BERT or similar for semantic similarity
- Visualization: D3.js for interactive components
- Database: JSON/CSV for mappings, possibly Neo4j for graph representation
- Testing: Validate mappings with domain experts

## Deliverables

1. Extended Python module with Schwartz values support
2. Interactive web visualization prototype
3. Comprehensive AI ethics to human values mapping tables
4. Research report on quantitative framework similarity
