:ID: context
:END:

This speech was delivered by Robert F. Kennedy during his presidential campaign, speaking to a largely African American crowd in Indianapolis. Kennedy informed the crowd of King's assassination, having learned of it just before the rally. Indianapolis was one of the few major cities that did not experience riots following King's assassination, which many attribute to the impact of this speech.

For those of you who are black—considering the evidence there evidently is that there were white people who were responsible—you can be filled with bitterness, with hatred, and a desire for revenge.

For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and distrust at the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I can only say that I feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man. But we have to make an effort in the United States, we have to make an effort to understand, to go beyond these rather difficult times.
