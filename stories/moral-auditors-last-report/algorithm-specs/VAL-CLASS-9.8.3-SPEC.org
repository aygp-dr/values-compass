** Known Issues

1. Occasional classification instability when processing highly ambiguous value expressions (P99 occurrence: 0.0023%)
2. Resource spikes during simultaneous high-volume processing (mitigated by load balancing)
3. Continued inability to process self-referential value structures
4. Classification performance degradation for values with fewer than 10,000 training examples

** Supersession Note
