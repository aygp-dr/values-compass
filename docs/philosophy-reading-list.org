* Further Exploration

The values dataset suggests a philosophical tension between:

1. Instrumental/technical values (helpfulness, efficiency, technical excellence)
2. Ethical values (accountability, responsibility, harm prevention)
3. Epistemic values (transparency, accuracy, intellectual honesty)

This tension reflects broader challenges in late-stage capitalism where market/technical values often conflict with ethical and epistemic priorities. The reading list provides theoretical frameworks for understanding and navigating these tensions.
