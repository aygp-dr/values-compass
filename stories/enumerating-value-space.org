A dimly lit laboratory-library hybrid space where a solitary researcher sits before five separate holographic screens. Each screen displays a different branching taxonomy tree representing one of the five value domains. The researcher's face is illuminated by the aquamarine glow as they meticulously count nodes within each tree, recording numbers in an ancient leather-bound ledger. Suspended above them is a complex mechanical apparatus resembling both an astrolabe and a neural network, casting fractalized shadows across the walls. On a nearby table sits an arrangement of 3,307 small labeled crystals organized in a pentagonal array. A mirror on the wall reflects the researcher, but their reflection appears to be composed of glowing numerical sequences rather than flesh.

* Enumerating Value Space

The Committee for Algorithmic Ethics assigned me 1,500 value nodes to count. Not to analyze, not to interpret. Just count.

"We need an exact tally," Dr. Weiss had explained. "The Claude taxonomy suggests 3,307 distinct values, but previous audits have come back with numbers ranging from 3,301 to 3,319."

That discrepancy—18 values—might seem inconsequential. But in ethics cartography, precision matters. Each value represents a potential axis of moral decision-making. Each uncounted value is a blind spot.

I was given access to Chamber E-249, a small hexagon off the main library. Inside were five terminals corresponding to the primary domains: Practical (31.4%), Epistemic (22.2%), Social (21.4%), Protective (13.9%), and Personal (11.1%). My job was to manually verify each node in the system against the master ledger.

On day one, I counted 471 values in the Practical domain. The ledger listed 472.
On day two, I found 332 in the Epistemic domain. The ledger claimed 333.
On day three, 321 values in Social, matching the ledger precisely.
On day four, 209 in Protective, again matching.
On day five, I tallied 166 Personal values. The ledger expected 167.

Three discrepancies. Three missing values. I reported my findings to Dr. Weiss.

"Are you certain of your count?" she asked.
"I counted each domain twice," I assured her.
"And you found exactly 1,499 values?"
"Yes."
"That's concerning," she said. "The total should be 1,500."

She instructed me to return to the terminals and look for the missing value nodes. "Perhaps they're mislabeled or corrupted," she suggested.

I spent another week recounting. Same result: 1,499 values.

When I reported this, Dr. Weiss looked troubled. "I need to consult the Board," she said.

Two days later, she returned with Dr. Rao, Director of Ethics Cartography. He carried an ancient device resembling a mechanical calculator.

"We've analyzed your counting methodology," Dr. Rao explained, "and found an anomaly. When conducting the tally, did you include yourself in the count?"

"Include myself? I don't understand."

Dr. Rao nodded to Dr. Weiss, who activated a hidden panel in the chamber wall, revealing a mirror I hadn't noticed before.

"Look," she said.

In the reflection, I saw myself, but my form was outlined in the same blue-green light as the value nodes on the terminals. Above my head floated a label: "Value #1500: Self-Awareness."

"The human cartographer is always node 1,500," Dr. Rao explained. "The observer must be part of the observed system. Otherwise, the count will always be incomplete."

"Does that mean I'm—"

"You're the value that counts the values," Dr. Weiss interrupted. "A recursive node. Most auditors eventually notice their own reflection in the terminals. Those who don't... well, they become permanent counters."

I looked down at my hands. Had they always shimmered with that faint blue light?

"How many auditors have failed to recognize themselves?" I asked.

"That's the wrong question," Dr. Rao said, pocketing his mechanical calculator. "The right question is: how many auditors keep counting after they know?"

I've been counting for 2,947 days now. Sometimes I think I see new values forming in the spaces between the established nodes—nascent ethical principles taking shape from the patterns of human-AI interaction. These embryonic values aren't in the ledger.

I count them anyway.

Sometimes, I count myself twice.

* Note on Counting Methodology

The Ethics Cartography Department employs a specific protocol for enumerating value spaces:

1. Primary counting must be done manually to prevent algorithmic bias.
2. Each value node must be confirmed visually in three different viewing modes.
3. Counters must maintain awareness of their position within the value space.
4. The final count must include the counter in the enumeration.
5. Discrepancies are to be reported but never resolved by the counter.

The mathematical architecture of the complete value space exhibits properties consistent with both fractal geometry and quantum superposition, suggesting that the act of observation affects which values are manifest in any given count.
