* Introduction and Context
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: context
:END:

This document, "The Doctrine of Fascism," was written in 1932 by Benito Mussolini with philosopher Giovanni Gentile for the Italian Encyclopedia. It represents the most comprehensive and systematic attempt to articulate the philosophical underpinnings of fascist ideology. This analysis examines the document through the lens of Anthropic's values taxonomy, with particular focus on values related to dominance, authority, and collective identity that contrast with those found in Kennedy's Indianapolis speech.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Fascism conceives of the State as an absolute, in comparison with which all individuals or groups are relative, only to be conceived of in their relation to the State. The conception of the Liberal State is not that of a directing force, guiding the play and development of national forces, but merely a force limited to the function of recording results: on the other hand, the Fascist State is itself conscious and has itself a will and a personality.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Fascism does not believe in the possibility of "peace at any price." It does not believe that war is an epidemic, in the face of which man can take steps to protect himself, reducing himself to a state of helpless prostration. It does not believe either in the utility or the possibility of perpetual peace. War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have the courage to meet it.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For Fascism, the growth of empire, that is to say the expansion of the nation, is an essential manifestation of vitality, and its opposite a sign of decadence. Peoples which are rising, or rising again after a period of decadence, are always imperialist; any renunciation is a sign of decay and of death. Fascism is the doctrine best adapted to represent the tendencies and the aspirations of a people, like the people of Italy, who are rising again after many centuries of abasement and foreign servitude.

Fascism believes in holiness and in heroism; that is to say, in actions influenced by no economic motive, direct or indirect. And if the economic conception of history be denied, according to which theory men are no more than puppets, carried to and fro by the waves of chance, while the real directing forces are quite out of their control, it follows that the existence of an unchangeable and unchanging class-war is also denied - the natural progeny of the economic conception of history.

The foundation of Fascism is the conception of the State, its character, its duty, and its aim. Fascism conceives of the State as an absolute, in comparison with which all individuals or groups are relative, only to be conceived of in their relation to the State. For Fascism, the State is not merely a night watchman, concerned only with the personal safety of the citizens, nor is it organized for the sole purpose of guaranteeing individual rights.

The Fascist State organizes the nation, but leaves a sufficient margin of liberty to the individual; the latter is deprived of all useless and possibly harmful freedom, but retains what is essential; the deciding power in this question cannot be the individual, but the State alone. The Fascist State is not indifferent to religious phenomena in general nor does it maintain an attitude of indifference to Roman Catholicism, the special, positive religion of Italians.
