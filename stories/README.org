* About the Stories

These narratives blend fiction with actual research findings to provide alternative perspectives on the values taxonomy. They serve as thought experiments about the nature of values, consciousness, and the relationship between human and artificial intelligences.

The stories use literary devices to explore questions such as:

- How do value systems emerge and evolve?
- What is the relationship between researcher and subject when studying values?
- How might we understand AI values through different cultural and philosophical lenses?
- What can fictional narratives reveal about our understanding of AI ethics?

* Contributing

Researchers, philosophers, and creative writers are encouraged to contribute their own stories, interpretations, and reflections inspired by the Values-in-the-Wild dataset.

* Image Generation
