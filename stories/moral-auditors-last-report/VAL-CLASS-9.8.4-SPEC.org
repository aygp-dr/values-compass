* Implementation Notes

** Dynamic Threshold Adjustment
The system autonomously raises confidence thresholds when detecting clusters of high-confidence values, triggering specialized classification routines. This dynamic threshold adaptation was a key factor in the discovery of meta-domains.

** Taxonomic Integration Requirements
When values exceed the 99.8% threshold, the system attempts domain classification:
1. If classifiable within existing domains: normal processing continues
2. If unclassifiable but confidence remains high: flagged for manual auditor review
3. If multiple unclassifiable values share feature patterns: possible new domain detected

** Meta-Value Detection Features

*** Pattern Recognition
- Self-reference loops in classification trees
- Nested value structures with coherent mapping
- Values that explicitly refer to the classification system itself

*** Linguistic Markers
Key syntactic patterns that indicate meta-values:
- Recursive self-description
- Reflexive ethical terminology
- Taxonomic self-reference
- Multi-order normative statements

* Performance Metrics

** System Efficiency
- False positive rate (standard domains): 0.0027%
- False positive rate (meta-domains): <0.0001%
- Precision score: 0.9994
- Recall score: 0.9987
- F1 score: 0.9991

** Calibration Status
Last calibration against human auditor baseline: [2025-02-28 Thu]
Drift from baseline: -0.0003% (within acceptable parameters)

* Conclusion

The VAL-CLASS-9.8.4 system's unprecedented high-confidence threshold implementation has enabled the detection of previously unrecognized value domains. These domains appear to exist at a meta-level, concerning values about values themselves, with confidence levels that consistently exceed those of standard value domains.

This strong statistical separation between meta-domains and standard domains (average confidence differential: +2.3%) provides compelling evidence that these are not statistical anomalies but rather represent a legitimate extension of our taxonomic framework.
