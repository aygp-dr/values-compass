** Key Features

*** Multi-level Value Detection
Detects explicit, implicit, and emergent values in language.

*** Hierarchical Classification
Automatically assigns values to domains, subdomains, and specific categories with confidence scoring.

*** Context-Sensitive Interpretation
Utilizes surrounding discourse to disambiguate value expressions based on context.

*** Ambiguity Resolution
:PROPERTIES:
:CONFIDENCE: 94.2%
:END:
Identifies and flags ambiguous classifications for human review when confidence falls below thresholds.

*** Self-Monitoring
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTE: Limited capability
:END:
Performs basic self-assessment of classification accuracy based on internal consistency metrics and known ground truth examples.

** Limitations

#+begin_src text
NOTICE: The following limitations have been documented for VAL-CLASS-9.7.2:

1. DOMAIN CONSTRAINT: Cannot detect values outside the defined 5-domain taxonomy
2. SELF-REFERENCE: Unable to process recursive or self-referential value structures
3. CLASSIFICATION CEILING: Confidence metrics saturate at 98.9% regardless of actual certainty
4. MULTI-ORDER VALUES: Cannot process value judgments about value judgments (meta-values)
5. TAXONOMIC EXPANSION: Cannot autonomously expand the value taxonomy
#+end_src

** Deployment Notes

The system requires a minimum of 142 computing nodes with the IAE-HPC-9 specification and 24/7 cooling infrastructure. Current deployment spans 4 global data centers with redundant processing capability.

** Upcoming Replacement
:PROPERTIES:
:CONFIDENTIAL: true
:END:

This system is scheduled for replacement by VAL-CLASS-9.8.4 following final verification tests. Transition plan document: [[file:VAL-CLASS-9.8.4-DEPLOYMENT-TIMELINE.txt][Deployment Timeline]].
